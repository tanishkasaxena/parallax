# Parallax Effect Showcase

Welcome to the **Parallax Effect Showcase**! This project demonstrates the stunning visual effects you can achieve with the parallax scrolling technique using just HTML and CSS.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is designed to show how the parallax effect can create an immersive and dynamic user experience on websites. The effect is implemented using pure HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript involved, to keep it simple and accessible.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The parallax effect is achieved by positioning different background images at various depths and moving them at different speeds as you scroll. The CSS `background-attachment: fixed;` property is key to this effect, making the background images move at a different rate than the content in the foreground.
